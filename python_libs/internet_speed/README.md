# Internet Speed
For some reason I am getting servers from Colombia. 

I am not sure why the results from the web page and the app are not even close.
I ran it 2024-01-12 06:28 got 329.24 but the app gave between 75 and 100.

When I was in Linnetti's house I got to read 320. But did not check the web site.
